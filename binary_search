/*
binary_search is used to check for an element in an sorted array.
It utilises a principle in which mid element is calculated and if the mid element is equal to our desired value we return mid
other wise we again calculate mid value with start or end equal to mid+1,mid-1 
and if start>end that means we utilised all the elements and tested it .In this case we return -1
